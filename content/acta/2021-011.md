Abstract

> How do we welcome you to the proceedings for a conference, intended for Heraklion in April, which will now be a virtual event, held around the globe? Let us hope the silver lining is that an even larger community will be able to enjoy the fantastic work that our authors put together for us. We certainly live in interesting times!
>
>Let's take a moment to acknowledge that the work our community does is serving the world today in an unprecedented manner. Our technology is enabling the greatest experiment in distance education ever undertaken; the fruits of our labor keep people, isolated in their own homes, connected; our systems provide access to instantaneous information and data. The work we do has never been more important, so on that note, let us welcome you to the technical program for the 2020 EuroSys. Regardless of how or when the conference takes place, we are honored to present this year's program.
