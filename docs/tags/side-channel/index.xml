      <description>Timeless Timing Attacks: Exploiting Concurrency to Leak Secrets over Remote Connections
29th USENIX Security Symposium, 2020 [PDF, Info]
Abstract
 To perform successful remote timing attacks, an adversarytypically collects a series of network timing measurementsand subsequently performs statistical analysis to reveal a dif-ference in execution time. The number of measurements thatmust be obtained largely depends on the amount of jitter thatthe requests and responses are subjected to. In remote tim-ing attacks, a significant source of jitter is the network pathbetween the adversary and the targeted server, making it prac-tically infeasible to successfully exploit timing side-channelsthat exhibit only a small difference in execution time.</description>
